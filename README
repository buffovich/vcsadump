1. Compilation

   Go "make".

   Optionally, go "make colortest" to compile a small test program to display
   all possible color combinations in a terminal.  colortest requires the
   ncurses library and headers to compile.

2. Installation

   Become root and go "make install".  This will install vcsadump in the
   directory specified in the Makefile, /usr/local/bin by default.  If you
   wish to allow non-root users to use vcsadump, see section 4 below.

3. Usage

   To make a console dump, a user must have read permission for the relevant
   /dev/vcsa* device, or vcsadump must be installed with appropriate
   permissions to enable read access to the device.

   vcsadump can generate three kinds of dumps:

   - Single HTML file with inline color attributes included in the HTML
     <HEAD> section (option -h).

   - Single HTML file referring to external CSS containing all possible color
     attributes.  This may be useful if you want to adjust the colors from
     the default (option -e).

   - HTML fragment with only the screen dump.  This may be useful for
     embedding inside another HTML pages, giving better control over the page
     layout.  You will need to provide the required attributes for color
     display on the page, either by linking to an external CSS, or by
     embedding the styles in the page (option -p)

   vcsadump can also generate a CSS containing all possible attributes
   (option -C).  In this case, no screen dump is done; only the CSS file is
   generated.

   The following aspects of vcsadump's behavior can be further controlled
   with options:

   - The virtual console to capture can be set with the -v option.  The
     default is to capture the current virtual console (/dev/vcsa).

   - The name of the HTML output file can be set with the -o option.  Using
     "-" for a filename causes output to be directed to stdout.

   - The name of the external CSS file can be set with the -c option.  Using
     "-" for a filename causes output to be directed to stdout.

4. Installation with setuid/setgid bit sed

   On many systems, it is not good policy to allow dumping of arbitrary
   virtual consoles by non-root users.  However, under some circumstances,
   such as when you are the only person using the system, you may wish to
   enable this for convenience.

   If you wish to enable non-root users to use vcsadump, you need to set the
   ownerships and permission bits appropriately.  For example, on a Red Hat 9
   system the /dev/vcsa files have permissions that look like this:

   crw--w----    1 vcsa     tty        7, 128 Jan 30 04:24 /dev/vcsa

   I.e. only the user vcsa can read the device.  Thus ownership of vcsadump
   must be assigned to vcsa, and the setuid bit set.  Now anyone who can
   execute vcsadump can use it to dump the contents of any virtual console.
   To determine who can execute vcsadump, you need to set the group ownership
   and execute permissions appropriately.

   For example, if you have a group "trusted" on your host, of which trusted
   users are members, set the group ownership of vcsadump to "trusted" and
   the file permissions to 4110.

   If you are the only user on a Red Hat machine, you can simply set the
   group to your username, which is also the name of a special group Red Hat
   creates for each user, containing only that user.

   Set the parameters in the Makefile, become root, and go "install-suid".
